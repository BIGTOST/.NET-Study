What is .NET?

Is CV# a part of .NET? 

How does .NET work?

When someone uses the term .net, what they means greatly depends on context. .NET is a colection  of many parts and peopla that together create  a 
powerful enviroment for building applications

.NET is an ecosystem for applications development
    The term ecosystem describes the multiple facets of an applications development enviroment and the community thata sorrounds it. These facets combine to create a compeling
    reason to invest in learning .NET and buildinding .NET applications.

    Use .NET languages and compilers to run applications in the .NET runtime
        Software development use .NET languages like C# and F# to write source code. Each line of code they write express the instruction or cammand the computer should perform
        while the program is running

        Before Software development can run their code, they must first compile it. The .NET compile is a program that converts the source code (in any supported programming 
        language) into a portalble language called intermediate language (IL). The .NET compile sabes the IL code into a file called .NET assembly. By compiling the code into an 
        intermeidate format, you can use the same code base wherever you run the code, whether on Windows or Linux, or on 32-bit or 64-bit computer hardware.~

        The .NET runtime is an execution enveironment for your compile .NET assembly. In other words, the .NET runtime is what executes and managges your application as it run
        on a host operationg systems.

        Fortunately, as a software developer just getting started with .NET, isn't necessary to get into detail of how these machanism work.
    
    Use .NET application frameworks and libraries to harnes prebuild functionality

        All software is build in layer, meaning software runs at various levels of abstraction on a computer

        - At lowerst level, software communicates direcly with your computer's hardware. IT controls the flow of data on the motherboard, processor, memory, and hard drives
        - At the next level, software allow the end user to provide instruction through an operation system.
        - At the next level, software like .NET provides a way for you to develop and run applications.
        - At the next level, application frameworks and libraries of functionality allow you to quickly build rich applicatios with less effor than older development methods

        A code library encapsulate functionality for a specific purpose into a single assembly. For .NET, thousands of libraries are available. These libraries can be first-party 
        or third-party, and can be commercial or opens soucer. The libraries provides a vast array of functionality you can use in your applications. You merely reference those 
        assemblies and call the methods you need. In this way, as a developer, you build on the work of other software developers. You sabe time and energy because you don't have 
        to build and maintain every feature yourself.

        An application frameworks combine several related libraries, along with starter projects, file templates, code generators, and other tools. You can use these resource to
        build entire applications for a specific purpos.  These application frameworks are know as app models . For exemple, .NET application frameworks are aveilable for popullar
        app models like web development, desktop and mobile development .

        You can install the .NET SDK directly or by installing Visual Studio 2022. The .NET SDK preinstalls a comprehensive set of libraries and application frameworks called
        the base class library. You can use this library of code in your programs regardles of the plataform or app models you want to build

        For other third-party libraries, developers use packges managers like NuGet to find and integrate code libraries from packges repositories like NuGet Gallery.

    What are the major app models?

        You might woder which frameworks support which app models. Use the following table to map and app model to a .NET frameworks

       .NET also powers popular third-party and open-source gaming development enviroments and engines like Unity.

    Use .NET tools to build .NET apps

        software developers rely on tools to write code, add references to code libraries, compile code, and debug code. This section describes several .NET tools
        you use to build .NET applications

        Visual Studio 2022 is the Microsoft flagship develpment enviroment. Millions of developers use it to build .NET application. A graphic user interface (that includes
        menus, Windows, visual designers, dialog boxes, and wizards) guides  developers through the application development process. Visual studio 2022 is avaliable in three
        edditions: Community, Professional, and Enterprise. Each edition includes different tools and is licensed for different purposes.

        Visual Studio Code is the Microsoft flagship code editor that supports multiple programming languages and is supported on windows , Mac and Linux. C# Dev Kit Extesion
        bring improved editor-first C# developmetn to Visual Studio Code and enhances the experiences of working with .NET projects with support for solution explorer, project
        system, testing enhancementes and explorer, AI-assisted development, and a powerful language service for best-in-class C# language features such as code navigation,
        refactoring, semantic awareness, and more.

        Developers who prefer a command-line workflow might use a combination of Visual Studio Code (the world most popular code editor), and the .NET command-line interface
        (.NET CLI)

        Furthermore, you can choose from numerous first-party and third-party tools for many advanced .NET use cases. Options include code profiles, unit test runners, and
        code coverage analyzers

    Find solution and answers in documentation and tutorials

        Microsoft actively provides a rich set of documentation, tutorials, and training, You can find learning materials in popular modalities to help you at each step
        in your learning process.

    How does the .NET ecosystem compare to others?
        If you're familiar with the software development world, you might wonder how the .NET ecosystem compares to others. Frankly, other ecosystems can make similar claims
        or many statements made so far in this unit.

        However, one of the most distinctive features of .NET is that its ongoing development and support comes from not only a major technology leade, but also the Community.
        Significant portions of .NET were developed through open-source menas. Community input and contributions are both welcomed and encouraged. In fact, 87 percent of contributions
        are outside of microsoft. Based on the community input of more than 100.000 accepted pull requests, microsoft actively moves the platform forward with feature enhancementes
        bug fixes, and performace improvements,

        Additionally, the .NET ecosystem has momentum
            - .NET  development number more than 5 Millions
            - The result of Stack Overflow polls consistently show that .NET Core & .NET are the most loved framework.
            - Students love .NET; 40 percent OF Developers who are new to .NET are Students
            - The GITHUB repositories of .NET and ASP.NET are ranked among the top 30 highest-velocity open-source software (OSS) project
            - GitHub list C# in the top fove programming languages, and the language is increasing in popularity according to the  2020 TIOBE programming community index
            - .Net has the fastest web framework on the planet according to TechEmpower benchmarks.- An independent open-souce set of web performace benchmarks that measures
              dozens of languages and application frameworks.

        A brief history of .NET

            The original .NET framework was first released in early 2002. Since then, many updates and more functionality followed. After years of enhancements and new features, the 
            original .NET framework, especially key code libraries, grew Significantly.

            After 2002, Microsoft worled to make a version of .NE that had cross-platform compatibility. The goal was to allow developers to write one code base and use it across macOS
            Linux, and Windows operation system.

            Through these efforts, .NET Core was introducted around 2014. Microsoft maintains the original .NET framework, but new features and improvemnets are reserved to .NET Core.
            Core was later dropped from the name. The next major versions are .NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET 8, and so on. Versions are typically releas each November.

            Why is the .NET history worth  mentioning? Because you're likely to find blogs, videos, and source that targets the origina .NET Framework. In some case, the instruction or
            code still work, but in other cases, you might need to make adjustments to fit the new .NET
