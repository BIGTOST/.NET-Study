What is .NET?

Is CV# a part of .NET? 

How does .NET work?

When someone uses the term .net, what they means greatly depends on context. .NET is a colection  of many parts and peopla that together create  a 
powerful enviroment for building applications

.NET is an ecosystem for applications development
    The term ecosystem describes the multiple facets of an applications development enviroment and the community thata sorrounds it. These facets combine to create a compeling
    reason to invest in learning .NET and buildinding .NET applications.

    Use .NET languages and compilers to run applications in the .NET runtime
        Software development use .NET languages like C# and F# to write source code. Each line of code they write express the instruction or cammand the computer should perform
        while the program is running

        Before Software development can run their code, they must first compile it. The .NET compile is a program that converts the source code (in any supported programming 
        language) into a portalble language called intermediate language (IL). The .NET compile sabes the IL code into a file called .NET assembly. By compiling the code into an 
        intermeidate format, you can use the same code base wherever you run the code, whether on Windows or Linux, or on 32-bit or 64-bit computer hardware.~

        The .NET runtime is an execution enveironment for your compile .NET assembly. In other words, the .NET runtime is what executes and managges your application as it run
        on a host operationg systems.

        Fortunately, as a software developer just getting started with .NET, isn't necessary to get into detail of how these machanism work.
    
    Use .NET application frameworks and libraries to harnes prebuild functionality

        All software is build in layer, meaning software runs at various levels of abstraction on a computer

        - At lowerst level, software communicates direcly with your computer's hardware. IT controls the flow of data on the motherboard, processor, memory, and hard drives
        - At the next level, software allow the end user to provide instruction through an operation system.
        - At the next level, software like .NET provides a way for you to develop and run applications.
        - At the next level, application frameworks and libraries of functionality allow you to quickly build rich applicatios with less effor than older development methods

        A code library encapsulate functionality for a specific purpose into a single assembly. For .NET, thousands of libraries are available. These libraries can be first-party 
        or third-party, and can be commercial or opens soucer. The libraries provides a vast array of functionality you can use in your applications. You merely reference those 
        assemblies and call the methods you need. In this way, as a developer, you build on the work of other software developers. You sabe time and energy because you don't have 
        to build and maintain every feature yourself.

        An application frameworks combine several related libraries, along with starter projects, file templates, code generators, and other tools. You can use these resource to
        build entire applications for a specific purpos.  These application frameworks are know as app models . For exemple, .NET application frameworks are aveilable for popullar
        app models like web development, desktop and mobile development .

        You can install the .NET SDK directly or by installing Visual Studio 2022. The .NET SDK preinstalls a comprehensive set of libraries and application frameworks called
        the base class library. You can use this library of code in your programs regardles of the plataform or app models you want to build

        For other third-party libraries, developers use packges managers like NuGet to find and integrate code libraries from packges repositories like NuGet Gallery.

    What are the major app models?

        You might woder which frameworks support which app models. Use the following table to map and app model to a .NET frameworks

        software developers rely on tools to write code, add references to code libraries, compile code, and debug code. This section describes several .NET tools
        you use to build .NET applications
